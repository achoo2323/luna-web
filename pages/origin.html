    <h1>Luna's Origin Story</h1>

    <h3>How Luna Found Her New Owner</h3>

    <p>At 6 months old, Luna was abandoned by her then owner and thrown out onto the streets :(</p>
    <p>The cat shelter found Luna and returned her to her owner but the owner said <strong><em>no I don't want her anymore.</em></strong></p>
    <p>So Luna lived in the shelter for a <strong>whole year</strong> and was about to be put down before a kind foster mum came to her rescue.</p>
    <p>Her new official mum is less kind but all Luna had to do was headbutt her once and she was like wow give me this cat <strong><em>immediately.</em></strong></p>
    <p>Now Luna lives in luxury while her owner works hard to feed her.</p>
